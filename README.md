# random-color-flipper
The project creates random colors for the background

### The project show the color value in two ways:
* The first way: by their names. You can get them in an array from here : https://gist.github.com/bobspace/2712980
* The second way : by their hex code.

### What did the project add for my knowledge?
* I learnt how to get elements from HTML file to JS file
* I learnt how to make random numbers with JS
* I understood the arrays better
* I worked on adding more comments for my project
### Sources
* I get the idea of the project from : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PHXvlpOkf4 , **but I write the code in my own way.**
